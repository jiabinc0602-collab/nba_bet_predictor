## Project Goals
1.  **Ingest:** Scrape player stats via `nba_api` and combine with historical betting CSVs.
2.  **Process:** Normalize team names/dates and merge granular player data with game-level odds.
3.  **Predict:** Build a model to predict "Cover the Spread" probability based on advanced matchup metrics (not just Win/Loss).

## Tech Stack
* **Python:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Data Sources:** NBA Official API, Kaggle Historical Odds
